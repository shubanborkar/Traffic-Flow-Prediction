## 🎨 Dashboard Sections

The dashboard is organized into 7 main sections accessible via the sidebar:

1. **Overview** - Project introduction and quick stats
2. **Dataset Info** - Detailed dataset information
3. **Model Performance** - Interactive performance comparison
4. **Architecture** - Model architecture explanations
5. **Visualizations** - Data and prediction visualizations
6. **Predictions** - Sample prediction demonstrations
7. **Conclusions** - Key insights and project summary

## 🖥️ Usage for Presentation

### For Live Presentation:
1. Run the dashboard: `python run_dashboard.py`
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`
3. Use the sidebar to navigate between sections
4. All charts are interactive and can be zoomed/explored

### For Static Presentation:
- Take screenshots of key sections
- Use the interactive charts to demonstrate model performance
- Highlight the best performing model and key insights

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Metrics:
- Edit the `load_data()` function to include additional results
- Modify the `create_model_performance_section()` to display new metrics

### Changing Visualizations:
- Update the `create_data_visualization_section()` function
- Add new Plotly charts for different data representations

### Styling:
- Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown()` sections
- Update colors and themes in the Plotly charts

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

The dashboard is designed to be responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile devices (with some layout adjustments)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Module not found" errors:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **"results.json not found":**
   - Ensure you're running from the project directory
   - Run your model training first to generate results.json

3. **Port already in use:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py --server.port 8502
   ```

4. **Dashboard not loading:**
   - Check that all data files are present
   - Verify Python and package versions

## 📊 Key Metrics Displayed

- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) - Lower is better
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) - Lower is better  
- **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination) - Higher is better
- **Accuracy** (for classification models) - Higher is better
- **AUC** (Area Under Curve) - Higher is better

## 🎯 Presentation Tips

1. **Start with Overview** - Give context about the project
2. **Show Dataset Info** - Explain the data sources and scale
3. **Highlight Model Performance** - Focus on the best performing model
4. **Explain Architecture** - Show technical depth
5. **Use Visualizations** - Make it interactive and engaging
6. **End with Conclusions** - Summarize key insights and applications

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all required files are present
2. Verify package installations
3. Ensure you're running from the correct directory
4. Check the console output for error messages
